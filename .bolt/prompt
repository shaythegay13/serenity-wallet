Guiding Principles for Hackathon Success:

Blend financial features with scientifically backed mental health strategies: make every wallet action mindful and supportive.

Prioritize a calm, inclusive, accessible design — everyone should feel welcome and empowered.

Use evidence-based behavioral prompts, progress stats, and community motivation to drive positive user change.

Iterate features in small steps, refining user flows and UI after each prompt for rapid improvement and hackathon agility.

Document every build decision and test with sample data for maximal transparency and judging clarity.

Winning Tactics:

Clearly align app features to hackathon challenges (e.g., wellness, education, community, or AI integrations).

Prepare a smooth demo: show navigation between key tabs, highlight smart automations, and emphasize your unique approach to combining finance and mental health.

Articulate your journey and learning in the project notes — hackathon judges reward strategic thinking and thoughtful innovation.
